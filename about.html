        <td>I was born in a small town in Texas and attended Memorial Christian Academy with both of my sisters until my 5th grade year when covid-19 happend. My family and I moved her during the lockdown in which from my 6th - 8th grade years I attended Stevenson Middle School. After I transfered over to Roosevelt High School where I hope I can spend the rest of my high school years at with all of the friends that I made in both middle school and high school. After high school I plan on going to college(Im not sure which one yet) and right after going the Army and start off as an officer.<td>
