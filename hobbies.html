I mainly love the raider team in Jrotc because of how great the people can be and the workouts we do together. Its also very easy to meet new people which is a great way to make new friends.</p>

            <div class = "why">I love volunteering at different places and doing different task like okinawan festival. Everything that I volunteer for will hopefully work towards making a better community like beach clean-up. Every time we volunteer I get to see my friends and people that Ive never talked to before and make a impact on the place or people that we are helping out that day.</div>
